                  <p>The purpose of this project was to write a surface shader that when used in conjunction with the previously written (water) displacement shader would give a simple object the appearance of being an animated flame. As with the previous assignments, the emphasise was on the vital need to carefully observe and document a natural phenomena before creating a digital version of it. </p>

                  <p>This reference photographs are taken with high shutter speeds to capture the form of the flame as accurate as possible. Also, I had to manually increase the F value to the highest value in order to get the right values and colors of the flame.</p>

              <p>The image sequence above shows how I created the basic flame shape and pattern.</p>
              <p>1. noise is remapped using smoothstep function and t value.</p>
              <div class="code">(1 - smoothstep(t - blur, t + blur, val));</div>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>blur variable is used to control sharpness of the edge while incandescence controls brightness.</p>
              <p>2. Blur is increased</p>
              <p>3. The image is inverted</p>
              <p>4. Inverted image is multiplied with the first image.</p>
              <p>5. The color gradient is applied.</p>
              <p>6. Another noise is introduced to the noise function.</p>
              <p>7. Gradient ramp is added to the result.</p>

              In the next step, my goal was to create a turbulent distortion of the st space. I tried to achieve that effect with spiral swirls deformations. For that purpose, I created a secondary st space which is deformed with built-in rotate function in Renderman.  Example on the left shows how rotation work
              from a single point on a grid. After I got the desired rotation and falloff, I created a loop that generates multiple swirls centers and moves them up. Also the rotation is multiplied with t value so that rotation angle increases while the center moves up.</p>

            This is a test with an actual fire shader juxtaposed with the reference video. Although the result did not match the reference, I decided to keep experimenting with this approach other possible results.</div>

              This is one of the resoults that I found very interesting because it resembles 2D fluid effects from maya and it renders in just few seconds. If I find time, I hope to keep experimenting with this shader. Also, you are free to take the shader and play with it. If you get any interesting resoults, please share it with me.</p>
